  Shopping has become either an activity or hobby especially around the holiday season. With the use of social media we are exposed to a multitude of advertisements that take place in the most casual forms. For example, celebrities on Instagram wearing the latest trends to YouTube videos of shopping hauls to straight advertising campaigns have lead to the support of fast fashion and the desire to be in trend at an affordable price.
  As consumers fulfill their appetite for cheap, trendy clothes the fact that the clothing industry is responsible for a fraction of negative environmental impact, such as the release of CO2 emissions, waste, and large amounts of water usage, rarely crosses the consumers mind.
  </p>

  <p>
    According to the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) and the EPA (US Environmental Protection Agency) as of 2014 industry is the third leading cause of CO2 emissions following electricity and agriculture.* Greenhouse Gas emissions from the fashion industry come from the burning of fossil fuels for energy in factories. This doesn’t just come from making clothes, but for producing material and fabric. The amount of water used to grow materials for certain fabrics is also an exorbitant amount. For example, cotton may seem like an ethical choice of fabric however, it can take up to 5,000 gallons of water to produce one t shirt or one pair of jeans. And while synthetic man-made materials appear to be more ethical, the production of synthetic materials causes issues with pollution. (Source: Eco-Watch)

    The rise of fast fashion has a crucial role in CO2 emissions, pollution, waste, and water waste. Major store retailers have made fashion accessible at the fraction of the cost of designer items. According to the  documentary, The True Cost, retailers will produce up to 52 cycles of new styles, in comparison to designers who produce two-four collections a year.

    In 2014, the United States generated 254 million tons of trash. About 87 million tons of the waste was recycled and composted. In a report gathered by the EPA, the U.S. “recycled and composted 1.51 pounds of waste of 4.40 pounds per person per day.” 67% of waste gathered in 2013 was of newspaper and mechanical paper 28% was yard trimmings and food waste, 27 percent was paper and cardboard, 13% was responsible for metal, 9% was for textile, rubber, and leather, wood followed at 6%, glass at 5% and miscellaneous waste made up 3%. While textiles stand at a small proportion of the waste, it is estimated to be 22.6 million tons of waste that is not recovered for recycling.  
  </p>
  
  <p>
    “The problem with sustainable fashion is that it’s never 100% sustainable” said Rebekah Haip, 20, a Fashion Design student at Parsons, The New School for Design. “A company or designer may do one practice that is sustainable, like make clothes from scrap fabric, but if the consumer wears it once, and throws it away it becomes waste.” 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    According to Rick LeBlanc’s, “How Clothing Recycling Works,” clothing recycling is the process of recovering old garments and shoes for processing. Products that can be recycled get split into three categories: reusable clothing, scraps, or fibers. Reusable clothing typically gets resold in thrift shops or for donation services, while scraps and fibers can be made into more textiles or used for products such as furniture.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In Elizabeth Cline’s, “Where Does Discarded Clothing Go?”, Americans only recycle or donate 15% of their clothing, while the rest goes into landfills. When clothing gets recycled, half of them get worn again while the rest gets torn apart and remade into things such as insulation and carpet padding. Organizations and charities such as Goodwill and Salvation Army make clothing recycling accessible by accepting donations however, the public is misinformed that not all of these items will be resold or given back to the community. A majority of the time these organizations simply don’t have enough room for them.  What cannot be sold is given to for-profit textile recycling companies, such as Viltex, who buy leftover clothes and recycle them.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Americans purchased five times the amount of clothes they bought in 1980 and due to the amount of waste caused by thrown out clothing, designers and retailers have committed to either no-waste or waste-reduced production.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    “In the United States, 68 garments are bought per person per year,” said Timo Rissanen, a fashion designer, researcher in sustainable fashion, and professor at Parsons, focuses his work around using zero waste. </p>

    <blockquote>"If China and India catch up [on the purchases of clothing] then it will result in even worse conditions for the environment.”
    </blockquote>

  <p>
    Rissanen put emphasis on “system” that works between the the manufacturing industry and the retail industry. As the population grows, so does automation and the demand for products. If rates continue to increase the efforts made to become more sustainable may not be enough to make an actual impact.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    “The levels of consumption feeds the industry,” Rissanen said.“It’s messy because it’s responsible for millions of jobs in many different countries that have completely different economic statuses.”
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The game of sustainability acts as a two way deal in the fact that it isn’t entirely the industry’s fault. If consumers aren’t educated in the process and the impacts of where their clothing comes from and at what cost. Rissanen says in coming years we will see brands and companies partake in informing consumers: “I do think we’re going to see across businesses, a transition where companies are going to take care of the issues of environment issues and human issues.”
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The initiatives brands and businesses take to inform consumers however, may not be enough because the cost and damage of materials and labor are dependent on where the material is being made and distributed. For example Levi’s partakes in using organic cotton, Nike has released a database of material sustainability, Madewell offers denim recycling, and Nudie repairs denim instead of selling it. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Another brand who has made a breakthrough in sustainability is Reformation. The site appears to be a typical online shopping website: photographs of garments, prices, and a list of materials. When the consumer views a product for purchase, they are also informed of how much CO2 emissions were released in the making of the apparel, and the amount of water waste and waste was made in comparison to the industry’s average use. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    “Companies who aren’t moving fast enough to change their practices won’t be around in 10 or 15 years.” Rissanen said.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In terms of materials, information on where they originate from often gets lost. Large material retailers such as Mood Fabrics, often sell leftover materials from large manufacturers.“The problem is that the information of where they come from, and what it took to make them gets lost in the process,” Rissanen said.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A good example is organic cotton. Realistically, there isn’t enough organic cotton in the world to make everything with it and there hasn’t been a way to figure out how to water organic materials or use pesticides in way that isn’t going to kill the land it is being grown on. “Another factor in making materials is what country it is being made in,” Rissanen added, “A cotton farm in India is going to take the same procedures as one in North Carolina.”

  <p>
    However, with the outcome of waste and pollution sustainability is taught amongst the new generation of fashion designers. “Designers don’t always source materials responsibly and many designers don’t research the ethical working standards of the factories where they are producing products.” Laura Sansone, Assistant Professor of Alternative Systems at Parsons, said. “ Many brands also design products that have very short life spans, and they don’t provide services for the end of the lifecycle of clothing and products.” 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    While it is encouraged for students to partake in sustainable practices, as part of the future of the environment is at stake due to the industry, there are limiting factors as well as opportunity. “There are opportunities for designers to develop new materials and production methods that are innovative, sustainable and ethical like biologically fabricated materials and 3-D printed textiles, for example. There is also a lot of opportunity to modify existing production systems in the supply chain to become more environmentally resilient and socially conscious.” said Sansone, “Designers are beginning to practice soil to soil production methods and work within new business structures that are more economically equitable, like collectives, and cooperative enterprises. The limitation comes from capitalist constraints and pressures to continue to produce using the same old models of fast fashion, and bottom line production.”
  </p>
  
  <p>
    While there are students who actively partake in sustainable practices by choice, some find them to be hard to attain. For Andy Chan, 20, a fashion design student at Parsons, he finds a sense of inequality between the generation of designers before him. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    “Our program teaches us how to make clothes. We aren’t provided with classes on climate change alone, so we are not provided with the right context as to how sustainable practices are helpful.” said Chan, “We can’t really be sustainable because we aren’t taught the full knowledge of it.”
  </p>
  
  <p>
    He finds sustainability limiting to his work as a designer, “I find it unfair that my age group has to worry about climate issues because every designer is interested in designing in different mediums,” said Chan.</p>

    <blockquote>“We need them [sustainable designers], because as everyone in the design field is different, we all focus on different things. That's what makes design interesting: we all wander into different fields of the same field with a different perspective.”
    </blockquote>

  
  <p>
    As a young designer, Chan feels the responsibility of practicing sustainability has been placed on his generation of designers. While the age of designers before him had the freedom to roam, in terms of finding their own style, techniques, and forms of expression, Chan feels young designers should be able to continue to do as those before them.
  </p>
  

    <blockquote>“It isn’t the designers job to be concerned of sustainability, it is the industry’s job.” </blockquote>

    <p>
    Rissanen said. As a professor, Rissanen expressed that they never pressure their students to incorporate sustainable practices into their work. It is taught for students to have options of what type of practices they want to experiment and work with. “The designer’s job is to make art.” said Rissanen.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As the industry continues, the first step to a solution would be to inform customers of impacts and for them to buy less. “It’s important to change our purchasing behavior to consume less, buy from ethical companies, and re-purpose clothing.” said Sansone. In order for any reduction in producing can begin, a decrease in demand must happen.
